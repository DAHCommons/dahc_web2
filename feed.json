This rich display of annotations demonstrates the reuse value of annotations and provides the opportunity for new forms of scholarly output.

Located adjacent to the emerging Digital Arts and Humanities Commons, the studio provides a space for production and critical engagement across media including games, data visualization, installation art, virtual/augmented reality, projection mapping, performance and installation, livestreaming, 3D modeling, mobile apps, and social media. In the future, we hope to expand our programs to provide the latest technologies for both our students in the classroom and interdisciplinary faculty/student research clusters. Through graduate and undergraduate courses; symposia, workshops, and other events; and team-based project development, we envision staging and sharing complex work in environmental and global media, and sparking dialogue among cultural producers, scholars, and activists around the legacies and continued importance of digital media practices.</p>\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wireframeucsb/\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wireframeucsb/\">Facebook</a>, or visit our <a href=\"https://wireframeucsb.wordpress.com/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>",

The general aim of the REM Lab is to assist in the development of individual and collaborative research projects, including papers, dissertations, and grant proposals, that seek to understand the interaction of religion, experience, and mind across traditions and cultures.  Meetings are usually devoted to graduate student presentations on research in progress and occasionally to outside speakers of interest to the group.</address><address class=\"align-center\">  </address><address class=\"align-center\"><img src=\"http://dahc.ucsb.edu/assets/images/groups-rem-banner.png\" alt=\"REM Graphic Banner of Devotional Practices\"></address><address class=\"align-center\"> </address><address class=\"align-center\"><hr></address><address class=\"align-center\"> </address>\n<h2 id=\"the-inventory-project\">The Inventory Project</h2>\n<p>Since its inception the Lab Group has been interested in developing methods for studying unusual experiences that may be appraised in different ways (e.g., as religious, pathological, or paranormal) across cultures, traditions, and historical time periods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-counts-as-religious-experience\">What Counts as Religious Experience?</h3>\n<p>We know that people all over the world have experiences that stand out for them, but do the same experiences stand out in all cultures? Or are people in other cultures watching out for experiences you would never think to notice?  And of the experiences that stand out for people, what do they make of them? We have designed the Inventory of Non-Ordinary Experiences (INOE) to help us answer these questions by asking people in the US and India, first, what they have experienced, and, then, what they think caused it, whether they thought it was religious or spiritual, and how did it affected their life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-inventory-team\">The Inventory Team</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ann Taves</strong>, Professor of Religious Studies, Project Leader, co-author (with Kinsella and Barlev) of the Inventory of Nonordinary Experiences (INOE)</li>\n<li><strong>Michael Kinsella</strong>, UCSB PhD 2017; Assistant Professor, Central Michigan University, co-author of INOE, ethnographer, specializing in American Religion</li>\n<li><strong>Michael Barlev</strong>, UCSB PhD 2017; Post-doctoral Researcher in Social Psychology, Arizona State University, co-author of INOE, specializing in cognitive science of religion</li>\n<li><strong>Elliott Ihm</strong>, UCSB graduate student (Psych &amp; Brain Sciences), specializing in cognitive social psychology (under J.

In the act of creative thinking, it tracks a circular history of print from the common hand-operated pull press, through digital technology, to 3D reproduction—the artifacts of which we integrate back into early printing practices. 3D plastic images and letters sit alongside metal movable type from all historical periods, together with wooden hand-carved illustrations in the “forme” of the press bed, ready for the “kiss” of the heavy tympan onto the paper laid upon the forme which produces the printed sheet.The pride of the Maker Lab is Mad Madge, a reconstruction of an early 19th-century Albion pull press, named after the eccentric Margaret “Mad Madge” Cavendish, poet, fiction-writer, and inquiring mind, most active in the 1650s. See the 2017 Current video documenting Madge’s celebrated arrival:</address>\n<p> </p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/235406198?color=c6e7ff\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/235406198\">Mad Madge</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ucsantabarbara\">UC Santa Barbara</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.
