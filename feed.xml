<p>This presentation will discuss two open source tools for creating and using annotations on images. One of these tools allows users to create annotations without requiring institutional resources or an installed annotation server. The second tool is a JavaScript library for displaying and using annotations. The library allows for the use of annotations for display and storytelling purposes. This rich display of annotations demonstrates the reuse value of annotations and provides the opportunity for new forms of scholarly output. This presentation will introduce annotations and IIIF (for which the tools are optimized), demonstrate the low barrier of entry to using the tools, challenges around creating and using annotations from multiple data models, potential use cases, future development opportunities, and issues of using annotations as scholarly output.<br><br></p>

<p>Our mission is to build a tech and entrepreneurial student community on campus by bridging the gap between our theoretical curriculum to the real world. By hosting a hackathon, student participants are able to utilize and apply their coding skills and innovative mindsets to budding projects or to creatively come up with solutions to problems facing our community. Our purpose is to provide participants with the space, support, and resources to collaborate with each other, to gain mentorship, and to work on their projects‌. We are using DAHC as a space to host our organizer meetings where we plan and prepare to make our next hackathon, SB Hacks IV, the best one yet.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://wireframeucsb.wordpress.com/">Wireframe Studio</a></strong> was established to support collaborative and cutting-edge research and teaching in new media, with an emphasis on global human rights, social justice, and environmental concerns.</p>
<p>From the outset, we have made UC Santa Barbara students a priority through innovative coursework, design opportunities, and stimulating public programming. Located adjacent to the emerging Digital Arts and Humanities Commons, the studio provides a space for production and critical engagement across media including games, data visualization, installation art, virtual/augmented reality, projection mapping, performance and installation, livestreaming, 3D modeling, mobile apps, and social media. In the future, we hope to expand our programs to provide the latest technologies for both our students in the classroom and interdisciplinary faculty/student research clusters. Through graduate and undergraduate courses; symposia, workshops, and other events; and team-based project development, we envision staging and sharing complex work in environmental and global media, and sparking dialogue among cultural producers, scholars, and activists around the legacies and continued importance of digital media practices.</p>

It gathered about 36,000 articles from major U.S. newspapers and other journalistic sources dating from 1981 to 2014, and analyzed them using advanced machine-learning methods.</p>
<p>The <strong>Text Analysis Hackerspace</strong> is an experimental research group sponsored by WE1S in order to extend its previous work and to contribute generally to research and teaching at UCSB. The Hackerspace group performs experiments in text analysis methods, as well as introduces text analysis to other students and faculty, at both basic and advanced levels. So-called “distant reading” computational approaches to text are increasingly important across a range of humanistic and social-science disciplines, and the Hackerspace puts UCSB on the leading-edge of research and pedagogy.</p>

<p> The objective of <strong>Scriptworlds</strong> is to build a new framework within which to think about language, literature and translation and to create a place for literature to find new relevance in the context of the notable advances that have been made in recent years on the neuroscience of reading and in digital technology.</p>
<p>This research will comprise the second part of the <strong><a href="https://www.creativeml.ox.ac.uk/research/prismatic-translation">Prismatic Translation</a></strong> project based at Oxford University and funded by the British AHRC (Arts and Humanities Research Council). It is a 4-year grant (2016-2020) and a strand in the <strong>Creative Multilingualism</strong> initiative.</p>

<p>Ethan Turpin uses old and new media technologies to explore human perceptions within large systems. He is dedicated to making learning spaces where people of all ages can engage in contemplation. Working as an independent video producer and artist since 1999, his projects have spanned topics such as climate crisis in 3D at The California Museum of Photography, to geometric growth at The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics.</p>
<p>In 2017 he installed three interactive “Video Organisms” at the Wolf Museum of Experience and Innovation (MOXI). In his current collaborations with fire researchers at UCSB’s Bren School for Environmental Science and Management, Ethan films wildfire incidents and produces user-controlled visualizations with support from the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>Ethan studied sculpture at the Victoria College of Art in Melbourne, Australia and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1997 from the Kansas City Art Institute.</p>

<p> </p>
The Lab Group is composed of faculty, graduate students, visiting researchers, and associated researchers including graduates and former post-docs. The general aim of the REM Lab is to assist in the development of individual and collaborative research projects, including papers, dissertations, and grant proposals, that seek to understand the interaction of religion, experience, and mind across traditions and cultures.  Meetings are usually devoted to graduate student presentations on research in progress and occasionally to outside speakers of interest to the group.</address><address class="align-center">  </address><address class="align-center"><img src="http://dahc.ucsb.edu/assets/images/groups-rem-banner.png" alt="REM Graphic Banner of Devotional Practices"></address><address class="align-center"> </address><address class="align-center"><hr></address><address class="align-center"> </address>
<h2 id="the-inventory-project">The Inventory Project</h2>
<p>Since its inception the Lab Group has been interested in developing methods for studying unusual experiences that may be appraised in different ways (e.g., as religious, pathological, or paranormal) across cultures, traditions, and historical time periods.</p>
<h3 id="what-counts-as-religious-experience">What Counts as Religious Experience?</h3>
<p>We know that people all over the world have experiences that stand out for them, but do the same experiences stand out in all cultures? Or are people in other cultures watching out for experiences you would never think to notice?  And of the experiences that stand out for people, what do they make of them? We have designed the Inventory of Non-Ordinary Experiences (INOE) to help us answer these questions by asking people in the US and India, first, what they have experienced, and, then, what they think caused it, whether they thought it was religious or spiritual, and how did it affected their life.</p>

In the act of creative thinking, it tracks a circular history of print from the common hand-operated pull press, through digital technology, to 3D reproduction—the artifacts of which we integrate back into early printing practices. 3D plastic images and letters sit alongside metal movable type from all historical periods, together with wooden hand-carved illustrations in the “forme” of the press bed, ready for the “kiss” of the heavy tympan onto the paper laid upon the forme which produces the printed sheet.The pride of the Maker Lab is Mad Madge, a reconstruction of an early 19th-century Albion pull press, named after the eccentric Margaret “Mad Madge” Cavendish, poet, fiction-writer, and inquiring mind, most active in the 1650s. See the 2017 Current video documenting Madge’s celebrated arrival:</address>
