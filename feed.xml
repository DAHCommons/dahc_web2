                <p id="dahc-projects">DAHC Projects are self-guided, hands-on exercises that introduce the basics of Digital Arts and Humanities research at UCSB. They are designed with the curious student in mind: someone who may not have a background in digital methods or research, but who is willing to spend thirty minutes learning about a new field or a new perspective. Since each Project is designed to reflect the research program of one of DAHC’s member groups, students are invited to make contact with groups whose work they find interesting.</p>
<p>DAHC Projects are not simply self-contained assignments but an entire media ecology. After all, DAHC is a hybrid online/real-world space that includes hardware and software, devices and data, tinkering and inquiry. As a public face to research and pedagogy occurring in DAHC, the Projects bring together resources and community members from across campus. Most of all, DAHC Projects are an invitation to join our community. Welcome!</p>
<h2 id="project-1-distant-reading">Project 1: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ckjmlYcWIvxhKu_Eo-xe6Iav7h_Gx1ioi5lWE5BKjtE/">Distant Reading</a></h2>
<p>Research Group: <a href="http://dahc.ucsb.edu/t_hackerspace/">T-Hackerspace</a></p>
<p>What would it mean for a computer to read a poem? The rigorous logic of the computer has obvious applications in the sciences and mathematics, yet such thinking appears to be entirely alien to studies in the arts. Reading a poem or viewing a painting can be a captivating experience that transports us as readers and viewers. Perhaps that work of art will change the way we think about the world altogether! A computer surely will not have that kind of experience, however it can discover patterns in works of art that escape human attention and that help us to see them in new ways.</p>
<p>This Project is designed to introduce newcomers to some of the most common techniques for reading texts with computers, or as we like to call it “distant reading.”</p>

Professor Fisher will address lay understandings of quantum mechanics and popular (mis)conceptions about potential overlaps with spirituality, introduce us to his hypothesis that the brain may function like a quantum computer, and discuss the idea that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608473/how-quantum-physics-is-about-to-revolutionize-biochemistry/?set=608484">quantum effects may be operative at the biochemical level</a> more generally.</p>

<h4 id="mcetoc_1dp4tn9cc0">Laptop checkout</h4>
</dt>
<dd>Windows and Mac laptops are available for general checkout from the Print Spot equipment cart for use in the Commons. The laptops use campus wifi; a pair of wired ethernet adapters are also available for checkout. These computers are “frozen” – meaning that any changes or saved data on these laptops will be erased once they are restarted. This is intended to protect users by preventing any personal data (gMail messages, SSNs, passwords, etc.) from accidentally being left on a shared public device.</dd>
<dt>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1dp4tnsal1">Wired networking</h4>
</dt>
<dd>A limited number of wired ethernet adaptors and network cables are available for checkout from the Print Spot equipment cart. All network jacks in the DAHC commons are active, and checkout laptops are registered.</dd>
<dt>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1dp4to9472">Media carts</h4>
</dt>
<dd>A media cart is a Windows PC computer and large screen TV with wireless keyboard/mouse peripheral. Carts are for first-come use, although they may be reserved for group meetings, classes, or events.</dd>
<dt>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1dp4todjl3">Analog technologies</h4>
</dt>
<dd>Seating and tables are available for up to 50 participants, and for large events there is standing room for many more. We make available five whiteboards. The Commons has lockers for secure storage; member groups should bring their own padlocks.</dd>
